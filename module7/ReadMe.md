# CPSC 2710 Final Project
This final project was created according to the Module 7 parameters, for CPSC 2710: Software Construction Fundamentals.

## Project Expectations
This project demonstrates a simple JavaFX application that a user might find useful. It is expected to:
- compile and run, opening the main window;
- have components in the main window that correspond to what the application is expected to look like when completed;
- include a variety of different types of controls and at least 10 total controls;
- include a menu with keyboard shortcuts;
- include a unique style such as color theme or customized control appearance;
- either include one or more separate windows that can be opened or use an animation to bring a separate set of controls into/out-of view

## Description
This project is a simple application entitled, "College Course Registration Portal". It is based upon the idea that the
user, already within a university portal, would be able to add courses to their registration list. The user is enabled to 
add course codes, course names, the start time of the course, and the expected days the course is available on. The user
also has the ability to update entries, add new entries, and delete entries no longer relevant or needed. After the 
application window has opened, the user also has the option to update, add new, and delete entries from the menu bar.
These capabilities are all currently functional.

Another capability of the application is the option to change the "theme" of the application window. The user has the
option to remain in a default "light" mode, switch to a second "light" mode designed with Auburn University's school colors, or
a "dark" mode. Switching between these three color themes are all currently functional.

One last capability involves the user clicking onto the "Add" button within the application. After including all
necessary details, and clicking the button, a new window generates informing the user they have successfully "registered"
their desired course. A "Close" button is included in the new window to easily exit from it and back to the 
registration portal.
